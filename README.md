<h1>Welcome to CO2MMIT</h1>

The CO2MMIT application is a digital carbon footprint calculation tool.

CO2MMIT is designed to enable members to calculate their estimated digital carbon footprint based on their digital habits and empower them to make sustainable choices.

The application uses data entered by the user through a series of questions about their digital habits and measures the estimated carbon emissions for each digital activity.

The app has four primary objectives:
1) build awareness of the concept of the digital carbon footprint,
2) empower members to take control of their digital habits,
3) enable members to play a part in tackling climate change,
4) members learn ways to reduce emissions.
